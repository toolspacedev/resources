# About Toolspace

It's amazing to see how open source evolved over the decades, which is now one of the most powerful terms of the 21st century. Indeed, it's hard to imagine the world without open source. For many, open-source is synonymous with Linux, Firefox, or a tool they either extensively use or know about. The very thought of sharing ideas, code, and knowledge for the good of the community has been the real revolution that helped open source gain traction.

Tools are created to solve some of the most complex problems; it's not uncommon to find open-source tools being used by NASA, Apple, and Google. Many companies, be it enterprises or startups, are open sourcing their software and inclined to adopt open-source applications.

**Open source is so much more than just a tool. It's a community. It's a culture. It's a way of thinking. It's a way of life ðŸŒž.**

Our goal with Toolspace is to build a platform to explore and showcase open-source tools while also getting the latest news and meeting your fellow developers. This can help you learn new skills and gain recognition in the development scene by forming partnerships. Our mission as an open-source community is to help others succeed!

We are offering Toolspace as the platform where people can learn, discuss, and share, anything about open source. Toolspace aims to create an impact in five areas: open-source tools library, news, spaces, community, and newsletter. We firmly believe there's no better way to grow in the open-source world than with toolspace. ðŸ“ˆ

> Our weekly newsletter is live, with more than 350+ (growing) subscribers. Sign-up [here](https://toolspace.dev/newsletter) for free weekly shots of trending open-source tools, must-read articles, funding coverages, and jobs.
